                This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of our
                TimeTap software ("Software") directly from Daniel Rodriguez
                or indirectly through a Daniel Rodriguez authorized reseller or
                distributor (a "Reseller"). Our Privacy Policy was created by
                the Privacy Policy Generator. Please read this EULA agreement
                carefully before completing the installation process and using
                Part Words software. It provides a license to use TimeTap
                software and contains warranty information and liability
                disclaimers. If you register for a free version of TimeTap
                software, this EULA agreement will also govern that version as
                well as any other version provided within the app. By clicking
                "accept" or installing and/or using TimeTap software, you
                are confirming your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to
                become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement. If you are
                entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a company or
                other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to
                bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms and
                conditions. If you do not have such authority or if you do not
                agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do
                not install or use the Software, and you must not accept this
                EULA agreement. This EULA agreement shall apply only to the
                Software supplied by Daniel Rodriguez herewith regardless of
                whether other software is referred to or described herein. The
                terms also apply to any Daniel Rodriguez updates, supplements,
                Internet-based services, and support services for the Software,
                unless other terms accompany those items on delivery. If so,
                those terms apply.
