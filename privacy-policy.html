                to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of
                information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information
                that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service.
                I will not use or share your information with anyone except as

              <p>
                The only data collected is the email, name or nickname and
                profile picture of the user when the create the account. This
                information is ONLY used to provide an authentication service
                within the app. The users can save personal info inside their
                rents such other people emails or phone numbers but this is up
                to the user. Again, any information that the users save is ONLY
                used as plain info for the user. The app does use third party
                services that may collect information used to identify you. Have
                a look to "Third party libraries" and have a look to their
                privacy policies. For this you can go to Option - About Us -
